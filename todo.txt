- export Q table (Q dict)  limit now: 8000 episodes, teoretically when Qvalues not changing (break on local maximum of max reward: if after X episodes reward does not improve over X% and map.visitplaces > x% then local maximum)
- agent able to import Q table's
- able to generalize -> THINK!!!
	. merge Q tables from differen parking lot "entities" by weigthed probability distribution of state * reward

- agent with perfect memory

	- Kullbackâ€“Leibler distance  is a natural distance function from a "true" probability distribution, p, to a "target" probability distribution, q
